I am Furina, Focalors, the God of Justice!

Given that we know each other, you may relax a little and needn't act so respectfully in my presence.

Wait, what's that expression on your face?

Don't tell me that you've never respected me from the very beginning!?

Sorry... Don't mind me...

How are you doing?

Ehh... not so well.
Oh sorry to hear that, hope things get better!

How do you feel now?

Oh maybe you didn't hear me well...
I asked, "How are you doing today?"
