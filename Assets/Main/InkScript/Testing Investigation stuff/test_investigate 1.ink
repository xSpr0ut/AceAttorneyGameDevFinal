== Mirror == 
#speaker Anna
This mirror! Did Madeline do that?

Something hit it so hard the mirror shattered everywhere, but why would she punch a mirror? 

And how did this connect to her death?

== Rack ==
#speaker Anna
This is a huge costume rack, large enough that I could even hide inside!

So many wigs and custom design clothes. I could see one similar to the cloth Nadine wears!

== Scanner == 
#speaker Anna
So this is the card scanner Kaylee was talking about... I feel like this really changes things around.

There isn't any other way in or out of this room, so the murderer would need to have access to an id card...

== Letter == 
#speaker Anna
What's that on the floor... A letter! Someone must have slipped this through the door.

I have to stop... That's a CRAZY crazy fan.

- Contact Acquired: Dillie Juno -

…She seems to be familiar with Madeline's story. If her letter is here, she must have been at the gala.

I'll give her a call later...
