Diego? You said you’d meet me back here. Anything notable about this place?

#speaker Narrator
— A head pops out —

#speaker Diego
There you are, boss! I was starting to think you fell into that merch bin over there… or worse! Someone offered you a brand sponsorship, and you evaporated instantly from embarrassment.

#speaker Anna
I don’t evaporate. I ignore politely. Now tell me what you found.

#speaker Diego
Well! Our little crime scene has two things calling your name.
 
The first is the manager! You know about managers— if they aren’t guilty, they’re at least sweaty about something.

#speaker Anna
And the other?

#speaker Diego
The backstage office of the manager and the victim herself. Locked since the police arrived ‘til now. There’s gotta be useful stuff inside!

#speaker Anna
So, confront the woman who’s definitely hiding five lies under one expensive coat and search her office. Got it.

#speaker Diego
Exactly! And honestly, boss… you’re terrifyingly good at making people admit things they never planned to say. I mean that as a compliment.

#speaker Anna
Thanks.
