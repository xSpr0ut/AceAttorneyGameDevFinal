What’s that on the floor… A letter! Someone must have slipped this through the door. 

#speaker Anonymous
“Dear Vic!!!”

“I love LOVE you! You’re all I think about. You’re all I think about. I actually had a dream about you, haha, like last night [scratched], I gave you a handwritten massage!

#speaker Dillie 
"Please write back kisssskisssksiissss OR CaLL me if you can not write me a letter, people really don’t write about stuff anymore… Oh I forgot to introduce myself haha… I am Dillie Shino, you can call me whatever~ Anyways! This is my number~~”

#speaker Anna
Okay now. This is it. At least I got her number… 

…She seems to be familiar with Vic’s story. I’ll give her a call later…

#speaker Anna
Computer… calendar… decorations… business cards… Nothing noticeable. Wait, business cards… business cards…

David Yellow! I know this guy. He is the best scandalistic paparazzi there is. Why is his business card here? I thought Kaylee hates these people. 

Something tells me that this is more than the murder. Perhaps I have to talk to him too.

#speaker Anna
It’s a new medkit. Normal office supply.

Wait, there’s something weird with this one…

[Open the medkit]

So much of the medical supplies are used already. This is unusual. Too much for an uneventful office… What had happened here?

I’ll ask Kaylee on my way out, hopefully she’ll cooperate more this time.

== Magazine ==
#speaker Anna
These are draft versions of a gossip magazine… About Vic! 

Some of the articles are highlighted with notes written by the manager. Could be important information.

#speaker Reporter
“The singer Vic, who bedazzled the world at the recent Met Gala with her avant-garde makeup, has been holding back the deepest secret of the century? Today I will expose what is hiding beneath that polished costume.”

#speaker Anna
This must be the scandal Rae told me about. The rest of the article is torn off and nowhere to be found. There is a handwritten note on the side, probably by Kaylee.

#speaker Kaylee
“This is unacceptable! Don’t the reporters know who’s their biggest investor? Remind them who they’re working for!”

#speaker Anna
I wonder if all of this has anything to do with the murder. What part does Kaylee do in this crime…
