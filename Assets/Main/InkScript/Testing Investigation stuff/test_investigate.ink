Computer... calendar... decorations... business cards... Nothing noticeable.

Wait, business cards… business cards...

David Yellow! I know this guy.

He is the most infamous paparazzi there is.

Why is his business card here? I thought Kaylee would hate these kinds of people...

Something tells me that this is more than just a murder. Perhaps I should talk to David, too.

== Magazine ==
#speaker Anna 
These are draft versions of a gossip magazine... About Madeline!

Some of the articles are highlighted with notes written by the manager. It could be important information.

#speaker Anonymous
"The singer Madeline Bain, who bedazzled the world at last year's MET Gala with her avant-garde makeup, has been holding back the deepest secret of the century? Today I will expose what is hiding beneath that polished costume."

#speaker Anna
This must be the scandal Nadine told me about. The rest of the article is torn off and nowhere to be found. There is a handwritten note on the side, probably by Kaylee.

#speaker Kaylee
"This is unacceptable! Don't the reporters know who their biggest investor is? Remind them who they're working for!

#speaker Anna 
I wonder if all of this has anything to do with the murder. What part might Kaylee play in this crime?

== Medkit ==
#speaker Anna 
It's a new medkit. Normal office supply.

Wait, there's something weird with this one...

#speaker Narrator
Opening the medkit...

#speaker Anna 
So much of the medical supplies are used already. This is unusual. Too much for an uneventful office... What had happened here?

I'll ask Kaylee on my way out. Hopefully, she'll cooperate more this time.
