I understand. I’ll tell you everything I remember—just… please go easy on me, alright?

I saw Mr. Halden hurrying down the street with someone in a hooded coat following behind him. Moments later, I heard a gasp and found him dead in the alley.

The hooded person didn’t run—they walked after him like they had all the time in the world. By the time I gathered the courage to follow, the alley was already silent.

I couldn’t see the attacker’s face, but their coat was drenched from the rain. Whoever they were, they didn’t even look back after the murder.

I swear I heard Mr. Halden whisper something before he collapsed. It sounded like he was trying to say a name, but the words never came out.

There were no other people on the street at that hour. Just Mr. Halden… and that shadowy figure trailing behind him.

Right after the gasp, I heard footsteps—slow ones—like the killer wasn’t in a hurry to escape. When I reached the alley, all that was left was the victim and a single puddle of blood.
