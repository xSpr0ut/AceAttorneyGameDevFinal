Eileene… you’ve been quiet ever since we left headquarters. Did something happen?

#speaker Eileene
Quiet doesn’t mean something’s wrong, Nadine. It just means I’m thinking.

#speaker Nadine
#expression hat_open
You? Thinking? That’s dangerous.

#speaker Eileene
Funny. Really. I wish humor fixed problems as easily as you pretend it does.

#speaker Nadine
#expression hat_closed
Hey, I’m being serious. You look… tense. More than usual.

#speaker Eileene
If you must know, I found something odd in the case files this morning.

#speaker Nadine
Odd how?

#speaker Eileene
A missing report. Page seventeen. Gone. Completely erased from the archives.

#speaker Nadine
…That shouldn’t even be possible.

#speaker Eileene
Exactly my point.

#speaker Nadine
So what—someone just walked in and removed it? Without triggering any alerts?

#speaker Eileene
Unless they had clearance.

#speaker Nadine
#expression hat_closed
You think it was internal?

#speaker Eileene
I think someone wants this case buried.

#speaker Nadine
Well, I hope they realize you’re terrible at letting things go.

#speaker Eileene
(soft sigh) Nadine… this isn’t a joke.

#speaker Nadine
I know. That’s why I’m here. Now tell me—what was on page seventeen?

#speaker Eileene
…A witness name. Someone who claimed to see the incident from across the street.

#speaker Nadine
And now they’ve disappeared.

#speaker Eileene
Both the witness and the report. Convenient, isn’t it?

#speaker Nadine
Eileene… do you trust the department?

#speaker Eileene
…Honestly? No.

#speaker Nadine
Good. Neither do I.

#speaker Eileene
Then we’re on the same page.

#speaker Nadine
Which means we investigate this ourselves. Quietly.

#speaker Eileene
Quietly isn’t usually your style.

#speaker Nadine
Then you’ll have to teach me. Starting now.

#speaker Eileene
(smiles faintly) Fine. Lesson one: stop making everything a dramatic line.

#speaker Nadine
No promises.
