This mirror! Did Madeline do that?

Something hit it so hard the mirror shattered everywhere, but why would she punch a mirror? 

And how did this connect to her death?

== Rack ==
#speaker Anna
This is a huge costume rack, large enough that I could even hide inside!

So many wigs and custom design clothes. I could see one similar to the cloth Nadine wears!

Speaking of that, where is her sunhat that was left here? Nobody could have taken something out of here since that night...

== Scanner == 
#speaker Anna
So this is the card scanner Kaylee was talking about... I feel like this really changes things around.

There doesn't seem to be any other way in or out of this room, so the murderer would need to have access to an id card.

Wait! Outside of the beauty room, about half a minute of walk, was the restroom Nadine was at when she heard the glass shattering. 

And now we know that the glass was most definitely broken before Madeline was dead!

== Letter == 
#speaker Anna
What's that on the floor... A letter! Someone must have slipped this through the door.

"Dear Madeline!!!"

"I love LOVE you! You're all I think about. I actually had a dream about you, haha, like last night [scratched], I gave you a handwritten message!"

"So sad the show got cancelled!!! If you see this PLZ text me at 647-xx8!"

"Please write back kisssskisssksiissss OR CaLL me if you can not write me a letter, people really don't write about stuff anymore... Oh, I forgot to introduce myself haha... I am Dillie Juno, you can call me whatever~ Anyways!"

That's a CRAZY fan. 

Well, at least I got her number...

- Contact Acquired: Dillie Juno -

#speaker Anna
...She seems to be familiar with Madeline's story. If her letter is here, she must have been at the gala.

I'll give her a call later...
