What’s that on the floor… A letter! Someone must have slipped this through the door. 

“Dear Vic!!!”

“I love LOVE you! You’re all I think about. You’re all I think about. I actually had a dream about you, haha, like last night [scratched], I gave you a handwritten massage! 

Please write back kisssskisssksiissss OR CaLL me if you can not write me a letter, people really don’t write about stuff anymore… Oh I forgot to introduce myself haha… I am Dillie Shino, you can call me whatever~ Anyways! This is my number~~”

Okay now. This is it. At least I got her number… 

…She seems to be familiar with Vic’s story. I’ll give her a call later…
